*NOTE*: This repository is deprecated due to the availability of [XMind's main source base on Github](https://github.com/xmindltd/xmind/). To manipulate with XMind files, Java developers may take advantage of the [org.xmind.core](https://github.com/xmindltd/xmind/tree/master/bundles/org.xmind.core) bundle which depends solely upon the standard JRE and thus can work with any Java project.
